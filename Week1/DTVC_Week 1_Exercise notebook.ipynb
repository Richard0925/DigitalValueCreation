    "## Welcome to our first Jupyter notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a markdown, where you can read text written in a \"normal\" font. These will be interspersed with coding blocks that you can run. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know, Python is open source code. This means that anyone is free to contribute to writing bits of it and anyone can use it free of charge. A collection of pieces of code is called a package: we install packages so we don't have to rewrite things from scratch every time. We can leverage what other people have already done!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, the first commands you will see here deal with package installation. These packages will be installed using \"conda install name_of_package\". You may also come across the code \"pip install name_of_package\": these are similar commands. As we are working with Anaconda, the first one is easier to use. But if for some reason, conda install fails to work for you, switch to pip (also, many packages are not available with conda, but only with pip)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works for most coding languages is that packages only have to be installed *once*. This is similar to downloading an app e.g. on your phone. However, packages generally have to be loaded or imported at the beginning of every session (i.e., every time you re-open anaconda). This is similar to opening the app on your phone. It means that the package is active in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, I am including some \"installation commands\" at the beginning of this notebook. In the future, you won't need to run those code segments again: you will just have to load them.. However, it doesn't really matter if you forget and run them again - anaconda will check for you whether they are already there, and if they are, will simply not reinstall them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are downloading an awful lot of packages here. This is because these packages will come in useful at many point in times in this course, so we may as well install them from the get-go. However, you will only need to have installed `numpy` and `pandas` for the rest of the notebook, so feel free to skip the rest during class if you run into trouble and try installing them after class."
